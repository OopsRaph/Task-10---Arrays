## Task 10

Arrays + loops, Acne Studios Archive.

## Tech Stack
HTML
CSS
JS

## Key Features
Search bar

## Mistakes
Not using overflow, specifically overflow-y with my window container. After adding it to my css it gave the ui a more satisfying design.

I gave up on the script I couldn't get paste how to actually implement the search feature. So I'll have to test my array and loop knowledge in another project and finish the rest of the code with typed AI code unfortunately. Screenshot of were I stopped coding is in the "where I failed", folder. 15/10/2025 3:29am

## Lessons Learned
I must use grid layout which I have looked into once before. To set a grid all I need to do is set the display property to grid = "display: grid;". If i'd like to deal with the columns/rows, I must use the "grid-template-columns"/"grid-template-rows". This will be followed by the amount of rows/ columns I want with their sizing for instance. 

"grid-template-rows: 20px 35px auto;". This gives me 3 rows with the value of 20px, 35px and auto.

"grid-template-columns: auto 300px;". This gives me two columns with the value of auto and 300px.

Pseudocode is so important to help you know what tasks need to be achieved.

If you set the input type to search it'll save what you've searched also a few interface extras provided by the browser.
